This is intended as an overview of the major changes

v5.9-SNAPSHOT
===
- Print the parsed values of a wildcard in DissectorTester::printAllPossibleValues
- Allow bad requests to be parsed anyway.
- Drop Apache Pig support (this tool is no longer used by anyone)

v5.8
===
- getPossiblePaths sorts the list by fieldname.
- Removed GeoIP fields averageincome and populationdensity which are not part of any real mmdb file.
- Dropped the already disabled Storm example
- Fully switched to Junit 5
- Require JDK 11 or newer to build
- Workaround for change in Unicode CLDR(and thus Java 17): they changed the short name of "September" in Locale.UK to "Sept" which causes parse errors.
- Fixed bug regarding escaped characters in headers.

v5.7
===
- Updated dependencies
- When adding a type remapping with an explicit cast this cast was lost and replaced by "STRING_ONLY".

v5.6
===
- Fix bug that in some cases values would be reported multiple times.

v5.5
===
- Handle HTML encoded values in the URL better

v5.4
===
- Updated many dependencies
- Fixed extracting the timezone
- In url parsing missing values are now 'absent' (i.e. not set)
- Handle loglines when the upstream module is not running (i.e. fields are a '-')

v5.3
===
- Updated many dependencies

v5.2
===
- Improve regex performance
- Added basic support for the NGinx Upstream, SSL, GeoIP and all other documented modules
- Added basic support for parsing the Kubernetes Ingress logformat variables
- Disallow some Dissector methods to return a null.
- Updated many dependencies: Hadoop, Flink, Beam etc.

v5.1
===
- Parse epoch seconds `%{%s}t`
- Added GeoIP2 dissectors for City, Country and ASN data.
- Improved output of dissector testing framework.

v5.0
===
- The %u specifier allowed a space which broke parsing if the field after it also allowed space.
- If a custom time format does not contain a timezone we assume a default timezone (UTC).
- Fix extracting milliseconds, added extracting microseconds and nanoseconds.
- Allow `%{%usec_frac}t` in addition to `%{usec_frac}t` (same msec_frac).
- Introduce a setterPolicy to determine if the setter is called in case of a NULL or EMPTY value.
- Replace Cobertura with Jacoco because of Java 8
- Remove Yauaa from tests and examples because of circular dependency between the projects.
- Make Java API more fluent (breaks backwards compatibility with external dissectors).

v4.0
===
- Switching to require Java 8
- Parser instance is now serializable.
- Added example on using with Apache Flink
- Added example on using with Apache Beam
- Rewrote Apache Storm code and move to examples
- Many changes in Exception handling

v3.1
===
- Handle illegal data: Double # in the URL
- Handle illegal data: Firstline is rubbish (Reported by Yong Zhang - java8964).

v3.0
===
- Accept the NGinx logformat.
- Output the httpd parser git info, build timestamp and version info on startup.
- Fixed problem when using a different root dissector than provided by default.
- Created a testing toolkit for dissectors and improved several tests.
- Allow a dissector to add an additional dissector (needed for custom time format parsing)
- Support for parsing many (not all) of the possible custom time format fields.
- Allow changing the parser even after first use (makes it more flexible to use).
- Allow a dissector to return an empty 'extra part' to allow an alternate form of type remapping
- Improved test coverage
- Dissection the setcookies expire value was not deterministic and an absent 'expire' value is now returned as null instead of the 'now' timestamp.
- Implemented `%{UNIT}T`
- Implemented converters between several closely related formats (BYTES/BYTESCLF, time related formats)
- Token based parsers can output multiple values for the same parameter.
- Implemented all < and > directives for Apache logformat
- Implemented `%{VARNAME}^ti` and `%{VARNAME}^to`

**RELEVANT CHANGES COMPARED WITH THE 2.X VERSION**:
These fields are now reported as deprecated.
- `%b` changed from "BYTES:response.body.bytesclf" to "BYTESCLF:response.body.bytes"
- `%D` changed from "server.process.time" to "response.server.processing.time"
- `%{msec_frac}t` changed from "request.receive.time.begin.msec_frac" to "request.receive.time.msec_frac"
- `%{usec_frac}t` changed from "request.receive.time.begin.usec_frac" to "request.receive.time.usec_frac"
- `%{msec}t`      changed from "request.receive.time.begin.msec"      to "request.receive.time.msec"
- `%{usec}t`      changed from "request.receive.time.begin.usec"      to "request.receive.time.usec"

v2.8
===
- Allow parsing mixed case timeformats
- Added the ISO 8601 'date' output for parsed times (Is string "yyyy-MM-dd")
- Added the ISO 8601 'time' output for parsed times (Is string "HH:mm:ss"  )
- Solve parse error when a HTTP method like "VERSION-CONTROL" is used.
- Fixed NPE in specific combination of cast and setter type and a null value
- Improved test coverage

v2.7
===
- Handle the effects of mod_reqtimeout giving a http 408 (reported by Diogo Sant'Ana)
- Added option to optionally continue even when some requested dissectors are missing (Java only).

v2.6
===
- Buildin fix for the problems in Jetty logging

v2.5
===
- Simply treat the `%{...}t` as a text field you can retrieve (instead of failing if it occurs).
- Change URI dissector to allow URIs like android-app://...
- Change URI dissector to allow % in the URI when it is not an escape sequence (like in `?promo=Give-5%-discount`)

v2.4
===
- Rewrote the way parsed values are passed around. Improves accuracy and performance in specific cases.
- Now support parsing the first line even if it is chopped by Apache httpd because of an URI longer than 8000 bytes.
- Fixed an infinite recursion problem.
- Fixed Timestamp unit test (test was broken, code was fine).

v2.3
===
- The raw timestamp extracted from the Apache logfiles no longer contains the surrounding '[' ']'.

v2.2
===
- Accept multiple logformat lines as a single 'multiline' input string.

v2.1.1
===

v2.1
===
- Dissect the unique ID from mod_unique_id.

v1.9
===
- [PIG] Support for getting a map[] of values (useful for cookies and query string parameters)
- [PIG] Output the possible values as a complete working Pig statement.
