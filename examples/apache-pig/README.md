README
====
This is example shows a few things combined together:

- How to write a pig script that uses this Loader implementation also tries to keep the pig scripts as clean as possible by using property files.
- How to write a custom dissector and load in into a pig script.
- Managing pig projects with maven (downloading the Loader from maven central).

The result of 'mvn package' is a tar.gz file that contains the entire project with all the required
dependencies in a lib directory.
