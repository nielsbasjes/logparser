The maven release plugin turned out to be too hard to handle.
So we do it manually.

# Ensure all has been committed

git status

# Ensure it all works
mvn clean package
mvn clean

RELEASEVERSION=5.7
NEXTVERSION=5.8

# Creating and publishing the new Tagging
mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=${RELEASEVERSION}

# Update the version number in all of the examples in the README*md files
sed -i "s@<version>[0-9\.]*</version>@<version>${RELEASEVERSION}</version>@g" *md
git diff README*.md

vim README*.md

git status
git commit -m"Version ${RELEASEVERSION}" -a
git tag -a v${RELEASEVERSION} -m"Tag Version ${RELEASEVERSION}"

mvn clean deploy -Prelease -PdeployToSonatype

#VERIFY If this all looks good

mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=${NEXTVERSION}-SNAPSHOT

# UPDATE the versions in this document

git commit -m"Start development for ${NEXTVERSION}" -a


# Finally is ALL went well we push it
git push
git push origin v${RELEASEVERSION}
